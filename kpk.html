<h1> BREIF HISTORY OF KHYBER PAKHTUN KHWA (KPK)</h1>
<h2> Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) is a historically rich region in northwest Pakistan, 
    known for its ancient Gandhara civilization and Buddhist heritage. It became predominantly 
    Muslim by the 7th century, later flourishing under the Mughal Empire. In the 19th century, 
    KPK came under British control during the Anglo-Afghan Wars. Following Pakistan's 
    independence in 1947, it became one of the country's four provinces, originally named 
    North-West Frontier Province. In 2010, it was renamed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
    The province has faced challenges like political instability and militancy but continues to
     work towards development while preserving its diverse cultural heritage.</h2>
