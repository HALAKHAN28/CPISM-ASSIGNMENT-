<h1> BRIEF HISTORY OF PUNJAB </h1>
<h2> Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, has a rich history shaped by various civilizations. 
    It was part of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, with key sites like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. 
    Following the decline of this civilization, the region became significant during the Vedic period
     and later fell under Persian and Mauryan empires. The arrival of Islam in the 7th century
      led to centuries of Muslim rule, including the Ghaznavids and Mughals, who greatly influenced its 
      culture and architecture. In the 19th century, the Sikh Empire emerged, unifying the region under 
      Maharaja Ranjit Singh until British annexation in 1849. The Partition of India in 1947 divided 
      Punjab between India and Pakistan, resulting in significant migration and upheaval.
       Today, Punjab is known for its agricultural wealth and vibrant cultural heritage.</h2>
